      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "utcGmt": {
        "question": "What is UTC/GMT time?",
        "answer": "UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. It is similar to GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) but is more precisely defined by atomic clocks. UTC is the time standard used across the internet and for international communications and aviation."
      },
      "timezones": {
        "question": "How do timezones work?",
        "answer": "Timezones are regions of the globe that observe a uniform standard time. They are generally defined as offsets from UTC, typically in whole-hour increments. For example, Eastern Standard Time (EST) is UTC-5, meaning it is 5 hours behind UTC. Timezones were created to standardize time across large geographical areas and are often influenced by political boundaries as well as geographical ones."
      },
      "unixTimestamp": {
        "question": "What is a Unix timestamp?",
        "answer": "A Unix timestamp (also known as Unix time or POSIX time) represents the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970, at 00:00:00 UTC, not counting leap seconds. It's widely used in computer systems and programming as a standardized way to track time regardless of timezone. Unix timestamps make it easy to calculate time differences and are independent of calendar conventions."
      },
      "clockAccuracy": {
        "question": "How accurate is this clock?",
        "answer": "The accuracy of this clock depends on your device's system clock and internet connection. While we strive to display the most accurate time possible, there may be slight variations due to network latency or your device's clock synchronization. For most everyday purposes, the time displayed should be accurate within a few seconds of the actual time. For applications requiring millisecond precision, specialized time servers should be used."
      },
      "iso8601": {
        "question": "What is ISO 8601 format?",
        "answer": "ISO 8601 is an international standard for representing dates and times. It follows the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ, where: YYYY-MM-DD represents the date (year, month, day), T is a separator between date and time, HH:MM:SS.sss represents the time (hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds), Z indicates that the time is in UTC (or an offset can be specified, like +01:00). This format eliminates ambiguity in international communications and is widely used in computing."
      },
      "daylightSaving": {
        "question": "What is Daylight Saving Time?",
        "answer": "Daylight Saving Time (DST) is the practice of advancing clocks during warmer months so that darkness falls later each day according to the clock. Typically, regions that observe DST adjust clocks forward one hour in the spring (\"spring forward\") and adjust them backward in the autumn (\"fall back\"). The main purpose is to make better use of daylight during the evening hours. Not all countries observe DST, and the start and end dates vary by region."
      },
      "timezoneConversion": {
        "question": "How do I convert between timezones?",
        "answer": "To convert time between timezones, you need to: 1) Determine the UTC offset for both the source and target timezones, 2) Convert the source time to UTC by adding or subtracting its offset, 3) Convert from UTC to the target timezone by adding or subtracting the target timezone's offset. For example, to convert 3:00 PM in New York (UTC-5) to London time (UTC+0), you would add 5 hours to get 8:00 PM London time. Remember to account for Daylight Saving Time if applicable, as it can change the UTC offset temporarily."

      "whatIsUtc": {
        "question": "What is UTC time?",
        "answer": "UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. It's similar to GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) but is more precisely defined using atomic clocks. UTC is the time standard used by the internet, international communications, and aviation."
      },
      "whyImportant": {
        "question": "Why is UTC important?",
        "answer": "UTC is important because it provides a standardized reference time that is not affected by time zone or daylight saving time changes. It serves as the basis for civil time worldwide and is crucial for global communications, aviation, scientific research, and computer systems."
      },
      "utcVsGmt": {
        "question": "What's the difference between UTC and GMT?",
        "answer": "While UTC and GMT are often used interchangeably and both represent the time at the Prime Meridian (0° longitude), they are technically different. GMT is based on Earth's rotation and the sun's position, while UTC is based on atomic clocks. In practice, they are usually within 0.9 seconds of each other."
      },
      "convertToLocal": {
        "question": "How do I convert UTC to my local time?",
        "answer": "To convert UTC to your local time, you need to add or subtract your time zone's offset from UTC time. For example, if you're in Eastern Standard Time (EST), which is UTC-5, you would subtract 5 hours from UTC time. During daylight saving time, this would become UTC-4."
      },
      "whyInComputing": {
        "question": "Why is UTC used in computing?",
        "answer": "UTC is used in computing because it provides a consistent time reference regardless of geographic location. This is essential for timestamps on events, synchronizing systems across different time zones, logging, and ensuring consistent data timestamps in distributed systems."

        "question": "How is age calculated?",
        "answer": "Age is calculated by determining the time elapsed between your birth date and the current date (or a custom date you specify). Our calculator provides the precise age in years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. We account for leap years, varying month lengths, and other calendar complexities to ensure accuracy."
      },
      "differFromOthers": {
        "question": "Why might my age calculation differ from other calculators?",
        "answer": "Age calculations can vary slightly between different calculators due to how they handle partial months and days. Some calculators might round to the nearest year, while others (like ours) provide a more detailed breakdown including months and days. Our calculator uses precise algorithms to account for leap years and varying month lengths."
      },
      "customDates": {
        "question": "Can I calculate age between two specific dates?",
        "answer": "Yes! Our calculator allows you to calculate age between any two dates. Simply enter your birth date and then toggle the 'Use custom date' option to specify the target date for the age calculation. This is useful for determining how old you were (or will be) on a specific date."
      },
      "enterBirthDate": {
        "question": "How do I enter my birth date?",
        "answer": "You have two options for entering your birth date: using the calendar picker or manual input. The calendar picker allows you to select a date visually, while manual input lets you type in the year, month, and day directly. Choose whichever method is more convenient for you."
      },
      "howAccurate": {
        "question": "How accurate is the age calculation?",
        "answer": "Our age calculator is accurate to the second. It updates in real-time (when using current date) and takes into account leap years, different month lengths, and daylight saving time changes. For most practical purposes, this level of precision is more than sufficient."
      },
      "decimalAge": {
        "question": "What is decimal age?",
        "answer": "Decimal age represents your age as a single number with a decimal portion, rather than separate years, months, and days. For example, 25.75 years means you are 25 years and 9 months old (since 0.75 years equals about 9 months). This format is sometimes used in scientific or medical contexts."
      },
      "whyNeedExact": {
        "question": "Why would I need to know my exact age?",
        "answer": "Knowing your exact age can be useful for various purposes: medical assessments, astrological calculations, legal documentation, or simply satisfying curiosity. Some cultures also celebrate specific age milestones that require precise calculation."
      },
      "noNextBirthday": {
        "question": "Why doesn't the Next Birthday information appear when using a custom date?",
        "answer": "The Next Birthday calculation is based on the current date and shows how many days until your next birthday from today. When using a custom target date, this information isn't shown because it wouldn't be relevant to the custom date you've specified."

It is the basis for civil time today and is used across the internet, in aviation, maritime operations, and many scientific applications.\n\nUTC is maintained by a network of atomic clocks around the world and is closely related to, but distinct from, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Unlike local time zones, UTC does not change with the seasons and is not affected by Daylight Saving Time.\n\nUTC is the time standard used for many systems requiring precision timekeeping, including the Internet, GPS satellites, and international air traffic control. Computer systems often use UTC internally and then convert to local time for display purposes.\n\nThe term \"Coordinated Universal Time\" is a compromise between the English \"Coordinated Universal Time\" and the French \"Temps Universel Coordonné\", which is why the acronym UTC doesn't match either language exactly."

It was historically used as the international civil time standard before being replaced in scientific contexts by Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).\n\nGMT was established in 1675 when the Royal Observatory was built as a reference time for nautical purposes and the British navy. It became the global time standard in 1884 at the International Meridian Conference, where the Greenwich meridian was adopted as the Prime Meridian (0° longitude).\n\nToday, GMT is still used in some contexts, particularly in the United Kingdom during winter months, but has largely been superseded by UTC for scientific and technical purposes. The term GMT is often used informally to refer to UTC+0, though technically they can differ by up to 0.9 seconds due to leap seconds and other adjustments in UTC.\n\nUnlike UTC, which is based on atomic time, GMT is based on astronomical observations and the rotation of the Earth, which is slightly irregular."

It was published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and provides a well-defined, unambiguous method for representing dates and times, making it ideal for international communication and computer systems.\n\nThe standard follows the format YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ, where:\n- YYYY represents the year\n- MM represents the month\n- DD represents the day\n- T is a separator indicating the start of the time element\n- hh represents hours (in 24-hour format)\n- mm represents minutes\n- ss represents seconds\n- .sss represents fractions of seconds (optional)\n- Z indicates that the time is in UTC (or +/-hh:mm can be used to indicate an offset from UTC)\n\nExamples:\n- 2023-04-15T14:30:00Z (2:30 PM UTC on April 15, 2023)\n- 2023-04-15T14:30:00+02:00 (2:30 PM in a timezone 2 hours ahead of UTC)\n\nISO 8601 is widely used in computing, data exchange, and APIs because it eliminates ambiguity in date representations and is easily sortable."

They are particularly useful for storing dates and times in databases and for performing date/time calculations.\n\nExamples:\n- 0: January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC (the Epoch)\n- 1000000000: September 9, 2001, 01:46:40 UTC\n- 1585000000: March 24, 2020, 00:00:00 UTC\n\nMost programming languages provide functions to convert between Unix timestamps and human-readable date formats.

Time zones are defined as areas that differ from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by a whole number of hours, although some are offset by 30 or 45 minutes.\n\nTime zones were first adopted in the late 19th century to standardize local time, which previously varied from town to town based on solar time. The concept was formalized following the 1884 International Meridian Conference.\n\nMost time zones are defined as offsets from UTC. For example:\n- UTC-5 (Eastern Standard Time in North America)\n- UTC+1 (Central European Time)\n- UTC+8 (China Standard Time)\n\nMany regions also observe Daylight Saving Time (DST), temporarily shifting their clocks forward by one hour during summer months.\n\nTime zones are typically identified using:\n- IANA/Olson time zone database identifiers (e.g., \"America/New_York\")\n- Abbreviations (e.g., EST, CST, PST)\n- UTC offset notations (e.g., UTC+2, UTC-7)"

        "longDescription": "Daylight Saving Time (DST) is the practice of advancing clocks (typically by one hour) during summer months to extend evening daylight and reduce artificial light usage. The exact dates for DST transitions vary by country and region.\n\nThe modern concept of DST was first proposed by George Vernon Hudson in 1895 and was first implemented during World War I as a way to conserve coal. Today, about 40% of countries worldwide use DST.\n\nDST transitions can cause various complications:\n- In spring, clocks \"spring forward\", resulting in one hour being skipped\n- In fall, clocks \"fall back\", resulting in one hour occurring twice\n\nThese transitions create challenges for scheduling, sleep patterns, and computer systems. The effectiveness and necessity of DST have been debated, with some regions moving to abolish the practice."

        "longDescription": "A leap second is a one-second adjustment that is occasionally added to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to accommodate the irregular rotation of the Earth. Unlike leap years, which follow a regular pattern, leap seconds are inserted irregularly based on astronomical observations.\n\nThe Earth's rotation is gradually slowing due to tidal friction, making the mean solar day slightly longer than 86,400 seconds. To keep UTC within 0.9 seconds of UT1 (time based on Earth's rotation), leap seconds are added when necessary.\n\nSince their introduction in 1972, leap seconds have typically been added at a rate of about one every 18 months. They are usually scheduled for June 30 or December 31.\n\nLeap seconds pose challenges for computer systems, which often aren't designed to handle a 61-second minute. Due to these complications, there have been proposals to eliminate leap seconds."

It provides a continuous, stable time scale that is not affected by irregularities in Earth's rotation.\n\nTAI is determined by a worldwide network of atomic clocks that measure time based on the electromagnetic radiation emitted by cesium-133 atoms. The second in TAI is defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 cycles of this radiation.\n\nUnlike UTC, TAI does not include leap seconds and therefore runs continuously without adjustments. As of 2023, TAI is ahead of UTC by 37 seconds due to the leap seconds added to UTC since 1972.\n\nAtomic time is crucial for applications requiring extremely precise timekeeping, such as GPS, scientific research, and telecommunications."

        "longDescription": "The Julian Date (JD) is a continuous count of days and fractions of days since noon Universal Time on January 1, 4713 BCE. It was introduced by astronomers to provide a single system of dates for working with different calendars.\n\nThe Julian Date system was proposed by Joseph Scaliger in 1583. The starting point was chosen because it is before recorded history and represents the point at which three major cycles used in ancient chronology coincided.\n\nJulian Dates are expressed as decimal numbers, where the integer part represents the day number and the fractional part represents the time of day.\n\nA variant called the Modified Julian Date (MJD) is defined as MJD = JD - 2400000.5, which reduces digits and places the integer boundary at midnight.\n\nJulian Dates are primarily used in astronomy and space science to simplify time interval calculations."
