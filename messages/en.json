      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "utcGmt": {
        "question": "What is UTC/GMT time?",
        "answer": "UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. It is similar to GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) but is more precisely defined by atomic clocks. UTC is the time standard used across the internet and for international communications and aviation."
      },
      "timezones": {
        "question": "How do timezones work?",
        "answer": "Timezones are regions of the globe that observe a uniform standard time. They are generally defined as offsets from UTC, typically in whole-hour increments. For example, Eastern Standard Time (EST) is UTC-5, meaning it is 5 hours behind UTC. Timezones were created to standardize time across large geographical areas and are often influenced by political boundaries as well as geographical ones."
      },
      "unixTimestamp": {
        "question": "What is a Unix timestamp?",
        "answer": "A Unix timestamp (also known as Unix time or POSIX time) represents the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970, at 00:00:00 UTC, not counting leap seconds. It's widely used in computer systems and programming as a standardized way to track time regardless of timezone. Unix timestamps make it easy to calculate time differences and are independent of calendar conventions."
      },
      "clockAccuracy": {
        "question": "How accurate is this clock?",
        "answer": "The accuracy of this clock depends on your device's system clock and internet connection. While we strive to display the most accurate time possible, there may be slight variations due to network latency or your device's clock synchronization. For most everyday purposes, the time displayed should be accurate within a few seconds of the actual time. For applications requiring millisecond precision, specialized time servers should be used."
      },
      "iso8601": {
        "question": "What is ISO 8601 format?",
        "answer": "ISO 8601 is an international standard for representing dates and times. It follows the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ, where: YYYY-MM-DD represents the date (year, month, day), T is a separator between date and time, HH:MM:SS.sss represents the time (hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds), Z indicates that the time is in UTC (or an offset can be specified, like +01:00). This format eliminates ambiguity in international communications and is widely used in computing."
      },
      "daylightSaving": {
        "question": "What is Daylight Saving Time?",
        "answer": "Daylight Saving Time (DST) is the practice of advancing clocks during warmer months so that darkness falls later each day according to the clock. Typically, regions that observe DST adjust clocks forward one hour in the spring (\"spring forward\") and adjust them backward in the autumn (\"fall back\"). The main purpose is to make better use of daylight during the evening hours. Not all countries observe DST, and the start and end dates vary by region."
      },
      "timezoneConversion": {
        "question": "How do I convert between timezones?",
        "answer": "To convert time between timezones, you need to: 1) Determine the UTC offset for both the source and target timezones, 2) Convert the source time to UTC by adding or subtracting its offset, 3) Convert from UTC to the target timezone by adding or subtracting the target timezone's offset. For example, to convert 3:00 PM in New York (UTC-5) to London time (UTC+0), you would add 5 hours to get 8:00 PM London time. Remember to account for Daylight Saving Time if applicable, as it can change the UTC offset temporarily."

      "whatIsUtc": {
        "question": "What is UTC time?",
        "answer": "UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. It's similar to GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) but is more precisely defined using atomic clocks. UTC is the time standard used by the internet, international communications, and aviation."
      },
      "whyImportant": {
        "question": "Why is UTC important?",
        "answer": "UTC is important because it provides a standardized reference time that is not affected by time zone or daylight saving time changes. It serves as the basis for civil time worldwide and is crucial for global communications, aviation, scientific research, and computer systems."
      },
      "utcVsGmt": {
        "question": "What's the difference between UTC and GMT?",
        "answer": "While UTC and GMT are often used interchangeably and both represent the time at the Prime Meridian (0° longitude), they are technically different. GMT is based on Earth's rotation and the sun's position, while UTC is based on atomic clocks. In practice, they are usually within 0.9 seconds of each other."
      },
      "convertToLocal": {
        "question": "How do I convert UTC to my local time?",
        "answer": "To convert UTC to your local time, you need to add or subtract your time zone's offset from UTC time. For example, if you're in Eastern Standard Time (EST), which is UTC-5, you would subtract 5 hours from UTC time. During daylight saving time, this would become UTC-4."
      },
      "whyInComputing": {
        "question": "Why is UTC used in computing?",
        "answer": "UTC is used in computing because it provides a consistent time reference regardless of geographic location. This is essential for timestamps on events, synchronizing systems across different time zones, logging, and ensuring consistent data timestamps in distributed systems."

        "question": "How is age calculated?",
        "answer": "Age is calculated by determining the time elapsed between your birth date and the current date (or a custom date you specify). Our calculator provides the precise age in years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. We account for leap years, varying month lengths, and other calendar complexities to ensure accuracy."
      },
      "differFromOthers": {
        "question": "Why might my age calculation differ from other calculators?",
        "answer": "Age calculations can vary slightly between different calculators due to how they handle partial months and days. Some calculators might round to the nearest year, while others (like ours) provide a more detailed breakdown including months and days. Our calculator uses precise algorithms to account for leap years and varying month lengths."
      },
      "customDates": {
        "question": "Can I calculate age between two specific dates?",
        "answer": "Yes! Our calculator allows you to calculate age between any two dates. Simply enter your birth date and then toggle the 'Use custom date' option to specify the target date for the age calculation. This is useful for determining how old you were (or will be) on a specific date."
      },
      "enterBirthDate": {
        "question": "How do I enter my birth date?",
        "answer": "You have two options for entering your birth date: using the calendar picker or manual input. The calendar picker allows you to select a date visually, while manual input lets you type in the year, month, and day directly. Choose whichever method is more convenient for you."
      },
      "howAccurate": {
        "question": "How accurate is the age calculation?",
        "answer": "Our age calculator is accurate to the second. It updates in real-time (when using current date) and takes into account leap years, different month lengths, and daylight saving time changes. For most practical purposes, this level of precision is more than sufficient."
      },
      "decimalAge": {
        "question": "What is decimal age?",
        "answer": "Decimal age represents your age as a single number with a decimal portion, rather than separate years, months, and days. For example, 25.75 years means you are 25 years and 9 months old (since 0.75 years equals about 9 months). This format is sometimes used in scientific or medical contexts."
      },
      "whyNeedExact": {
        "question": "Why would I need to know my exact age?",
        "answer": "Knowing your exact age can be useful for various purposes: medical assessments, astrological calculations, legal documentation, or simply satisfying curiosity. Some cultures also celebrate specific age milestones that require precise calculation."
      },
      "noNextBirthday": {
        "question": "Why doesn't the Next Birthday information appear when using a custom date?",
        "answer": "The Next Birthday calculation is based on the current date and shows how many days until your next birthday from today. When using a custom target date, this information isn't shown because it wouldn't be relevant to the custom date you've specified."
